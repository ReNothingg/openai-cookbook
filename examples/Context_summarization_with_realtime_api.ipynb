    "# 🎙️ Context Summarization with Realtime API\n",
    "## 1 · Overview\n",
    "Build an end‑to‑end **voice bot** that listens to your mic, speaks back in real time and **summarises long conversations** so quality never drops.\n",
    "### 🏃‍♂️ What You’ll Build\n",
    "1. **Live microphone streaming** → OpenAI *Realtime* (voice‑to‑voice) endpoint.\n",
    "2. **Instant transcripts & speech playback** on every turn.\n",
    "3. **Conversation state container** that stores **every** user/assistant message.\n",
    "4. **Automatic “context trim”** – when the token window nears 32 k, older turns are compressed into a summary.\n",
    "5. **Extensible design** you can adapt to support customer‑support bots, kiosks, or multilingual assistants.\n",

    "| Capture audio with `sounddevice` | Low‑latency input is critical for natural UX |\n",
    "| Use WebSockets with the OpenAI **Realtime** API | Streams beats polling for speed & simplicity |\n",
    "| Track token usage and detect when to summarize context | Prevents quality loss in long chats |\n",
    "| Summarise & prune history on‑the‑fly | Keeps conversations coherent without manual resets |\n",

    "### 🔧 Prerequisites\n",

    "| Requirement | Details |\n",
    "|-------------|---------|\n",
    "| **Python ≥ 3.10** | Will ensure that you don't hit any issues |\n",

    "\n",
    "*Notes:*\n",
    "> 1. Why 32 k? OpenAI’s public guidance notes that quality begins to decline well before the full 128 k token limit; 32 k is a conservative threshold observed in practice.\n",

    "[assistant] Once upon a time, in a cozy little village, there lived a baker named Lucy. Known for her magical touch with pastries, Lucy dreamed of creating a pie so extraordinary, it would put their village on the map.  One day, news of a royal pie contest reached the village. The winner would earn a place in the royal kitchen, and Lucy knew this was her chance. She experimented day and night, seeking the perfect recipe.  Finally, she crafted a pie with a golden crust, filled with enchanted berries that shimmered. The day of the contest arrived, and Lucy's pie dazzled the judges, winning first place!  Her victory brought fame to the village, and Lucy's bakery became a beloved destination for all. And so, Lucy's dream came true, one delicious pie at a time.  (item_BTfOaW9YNEXg1c7jAVP71)\n",

    "| **Vary thresholds**<br/>Play with `SUMMARY_TRIGGER_TOKENS` (2 k → 8 k). | The sweet spot between model drift and summarisation overhead. |\n",
    "| **Batch‑summary mode**<br/>Instead of every 4 000 tokens, summarise every *N* minutes. | Whether time‑based trimming feels more natural in certain UX flows. |\n",
    "| **Cost tracing**<br/>Log `usage.total_tokens` before/after summarisation. | Concrete ROI: token savings per hour of conversation. |\n",
