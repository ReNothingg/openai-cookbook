    "# 🎙️ Context Summarization with Realtime API\n",
    "## 1 · Overview\n",
    "Build an end‑to‑end **voice bot** that listens to your mic, speaks back in real time and **summarises long conversations** so quality never drops.\n",
    "### 🏃‍♂️ What You’ll Build\n",
    "1. **Live microphone streaming** → OpenAI *Realtime* (voice‑to‑voice) endpoint.\n",
    "2. **Instant transcripts & speech playback** on every turn.\n",
    "3. **Conversation state container** that stores **every** user/assistant message.\n",
    "4. **Automatic “context trim”** – when the token window nears 32 k, older turns are compressed into a summary.\n",
    "5. **Extensible design** you can adapt to support customer‑support bots, kiosks, or multilingual assistants.\n",

    "| Skill | Why it matters |\n",
    "|-------|----------------|\n",
    "| Capture audio with `sounddevice` | Low‑latency input is critical for natural UX |\n",
    "| Use WebSockets with the OpenAI **Realtime** API | Streams beats polling for speed & simplicity |\n",
    "| Track token usage and detect when to summarize context | Prevents quality loss in long chats |\n",
    "| Summarise & prune history on‑the‑fly | Keeps conversations coherent without manual resets |\n",

    "*Notes:*\n",
    "> 1. Why 32 k? OpenAI’s public guidance notes that quality begins to decline well before the full 128 k token limit; 32 k is a conservative threshold observed in practice.\n",

The wedding turned into a town-wide cake feast!  **Story Two:** A mischievous dog named Sparky loved to play pranks. One day, he swapped his owner's phone with a squeaky toy, causing a hilarious mix-up of barks, squeaks, and confused calls. Sparky's owner ended up having a full conversation with the mailman, all in squeaks!  **Story Three:** In a small town, a parrot named Polly became a local celebrity for reciting tongue twisters. One day, Polly challenged the mayor to a tongue twister duel. The mayor, tongue-tied and laughing, declared Polly the official town jester. Polly squawked with pride, and the town rang with laughter for days.  (item_BTuNNpNxki5ynSQ5c3Xsa)\n",

    "[assistant] Once upon a time, in a cozy little village, there was a cat named Whiskers who was always getting into trouble. One sunny day, Whiskers found a mysterious glowing stone in the garden. Curious, he pawed at it, and poof! The stone granted him the ability to talk to birds. Whiskers and his new bird friends had grand adventures, solving mysteries and exploring the village. And from that day on, Whiskers was known as the most adventurous cat in the village. The end.

    "| **Swap summary styles**<br/>Change the system prompt to bullet points, JSON, English vs French, etc. | Which format the downstream assistant absorbs best; how language choice influences follow‑up answers. |\n",
    "| **Vary thresholds**<br/>Play with `SUMMARY_TRIGGER_TOKENS` (2 k → 8 k). | The sweet spot between model drift and summarisation overhead. |\n",
    "| **Cost tracing**<br/>Log `usage.total_tokens` before/after summarisation. | Concrete ROI: token savings per hour of conversation. |\n",
